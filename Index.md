Avaloria is a grand adventure just waiting to happen, and the best part is it plays out however you imagine it in your head.  This wiki is here to provide not only insight into the lore of the game world, but also to guide potential new coders on their way to becoming a developer for the game.

Avaloria is a text based mud that is built upon the Evennia Server.  The game takes place in Avaloria, a fantasy based RPG realm that is utter turmoil.  The God's are warring amongst each other, new God's have taken form and are strangling the life from the world, and old God's are starting to pick the strongest souls from the River of the Afterlife to create and construct Demi-God's to use as Generals in their armies.

There are structures to build, quests to complete and monsters to slay.  There are skills to find, learn and use.  There are spells and potions along with a fully tiered equipment system with multiple slots.  Just about everything in game awards a bonus of some type.  Players are given their own Room (Lair) to construct structures in and raise armies of minions/henchmen.  These followers are then used to attack other lair's of opposing factions.

Avaloria is an ever growing, ever deepening world that begs to be explored.
