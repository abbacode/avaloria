      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Avaloria!  A world of mystery, turmoil and wonder awaits you in the kingdom of Avaloria.  The Deities of the world are gearing up for yet another internal conflict causing untold changes to the world and ecosystem of the planet.  In the recent years, ice caps have melted back, allowing a completely new deity to surface and take hold turning the newly available land into a vast system of Swamps and Marshland.  However, most will not sit by and idly watch as their land is devoured by the never ending marshland.  The Green Warden, protector of the Forests is in direct conflict with Slyth, causing never before seen deity warfar spanning large swathes of land.

        To the northwest portion of the continent, Mount Zuldrom stands as a monolithic representation of the entire Earthen identity,  Inside it's bowels stir the newly born creations of a darkness not yet seen in the entire history of Avaloria as a world.  Alongside the creatures of the dark lay ruins of the Earthen civilization, ripe for the taking if anyone could get to them.  The townfolk have been chattering away with rumors of the times changing.  Something big is happening soon and the entirety of the Avaloria's population knows it, from the Earthen deep in the Mountain, to the Erelania high above in the Zuldrom peaks; everyone is aware that a storm is on the horizon.  This is why the All Father, eldest of the God's has plucked your soul from the Sea of the Dead and returned you to a corpoeral body.  Avaloria needs as many heroes as it can muster as the twilight of this age draws to the a close, only those of stout mind and body will be able to stand against the overwhelming darkness.
