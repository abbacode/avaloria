You hear this creature before you see it.  Loud shouting in a completely
incomphrensible language alerts you to its presence right away.  It does
not 'shuffle' along as the previous corpses you have encountered, but rather
moves very quickly from one place to the next, never staying still.  It's eyes
are blood red and face is stained red from who knows what.  You really probably
are better off not knowing.
