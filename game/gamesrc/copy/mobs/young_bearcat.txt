As the bearcat notices you, it shrinks down to the ground and begins
to slowly back towards the cover of the surrounding brush.  This seems
to be a very young bearcat, barely able to fend for itself.  It's fangs
are small, tiny almost compared to his full grown brethren.  It seems
more afraid of you than you are of it.
