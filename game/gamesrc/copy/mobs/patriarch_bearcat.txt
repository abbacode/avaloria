As the creature notices you, it turns to face you emitting a deep growl.
The face is that of a bear, but its body is sleek and agile like a feline.
This particular specimen is quite large and muscular with a large mane around
its neck.  Standing on two legs, it is far taller than the average humanoid.
As it looks at you, you notice it is grinning, showing a dazzling array of
sharp, jagged teeth.
