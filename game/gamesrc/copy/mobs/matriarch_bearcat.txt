Smaller than their male counterpart, this creature is just as deadly.
Her fur is a light brown, striped with green and black bands around the body.
As the creature notices you, it turns towards you emitting a high pitched
chortle and showing its fearsome fangs.  It lowers it's head and looks ready
to pounce.
