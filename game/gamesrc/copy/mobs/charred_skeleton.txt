This skeleton has been clearly blasted with fire at some point in
undeath.  The bones are blackened and charred to the core, which 
thankfully for you means they are far more brittle than normal bones.
The skeleton notices you, and begins to lumber towards you.  You can
hear the distinctive "Click, scrrrape, click, scraaaape" as it lazily
gimps along the stone floor.
