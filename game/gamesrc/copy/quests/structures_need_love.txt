Now that you have built some basic structures, you should begin to level them up.
The way to do this is to deposit your gold you have earned in to them, once enough
gold has been deposited the structure will level increasing its attributes, and it's
attribute bonuses.

You should have enough gold to level your gold mine, and definitely enough to level 
our defenses.

To do this use the @construct/deposit command.  Help @construct for more information.

{gObjectives{n:
    - Deposit enough gold into a structure to make it increase in level.
