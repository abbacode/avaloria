You are young.  You do not yet know your true calling or purpose.  We have 
much work to do with you.  Across the way you will notice a chest, that very 
clearly is missing a piece of itself.  If you can find the missing piece, 
you are entitled to whatever you may find inside the chest itself.  It seems
to be hopelessly lost somewhere outside this small sanctuary.  Try using the 
Stone Summoning Circle and proceeding through the portal it creates.

This seal will also grant you the ability to begin construction of your lair.
Your deity demands you build a homage to their visage to attract more followers.
This large room has been carved out of the largest mountain in the land, with the
specific purpose of housing you and your soon to be army.  Welcome to the war,

General.
