"You must help me brave adventurer!  My brother and I were trying to cross
the Marshlands so that we could bring goods bought at the Crossroads back to
our village.  It seems the forces of Slyth have grown ever stronger during our
stay in The Crossroads." says the woman, face smudged with dirt.

She looks at the ground, suddenly silent as a wave of grief washes over her
face.

"They killed my brother, Alexander!" The woman screams to your, tears streaming
down her face. Then as quickly as the tears started, they stopped.  In a very
stern voice, the lady tells you: "Be my blade of vengence adventurer".
