You have helped me before, so I am coming to you again.  In my rapid fleeing from the marshlands
I seem to have lost an item of utmost importance.  It is a beautiful, golden necklace with a bright
Karith ruby in the middle of it.  This necklace is more important you, me or anyone in this camp.
It absolutely can not fall into the wrong hands.  We must find it.

It could be anywhere, or in any creatures hands by this point.  Please search the marshlands
and find it!
