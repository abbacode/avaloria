We have been striking at the heart of the Unnatural forces quite well so far.
I sense that there are more generals and lieutenants are being summong and created
to organize for the topside assuault. As you can imagine this would be devestating
to our world.  We can not allow their leadership to gain foothold.  You must go
back to the innards of Mount Zuldrom and hunt out the boss's of the Unnatural
forces which are gathering there.

Avaloria's immediate future depends on it.  

{gObjectives:{n
    -Kill 3 Unnatural Bosses
    -Loot a rare item from them

You must kill the gathering leaders of he Unnatural.
