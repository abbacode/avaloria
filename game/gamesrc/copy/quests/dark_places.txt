I feel a string evil presence quite close to our small base of operations we have here.
Use the stone summoning circle to open a portal to the concentration of evil, step through
and mightily smite any who may get in your way.  These will be the most unnatural creatures
you have encountered, but you must act swiftly and in my name.

{gObjectives:{n
    - Kill three creatures on the other side of the Glowing Red portal.
    - Kill the ringleader of the operation.

This otherworldly presence must be eradicated.
