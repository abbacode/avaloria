# Points of Interest #

The different cultures and physical geography has created many memorable locations throughout Avaloria.  This is but a small representation of areas that have been known to interest inhabitants of Avaloria.

## The Crossroads ##

_In a large man-made clearing, all the paths converge into one giant crossroads.  This area is a new addition to the landscape of Avaloria.  As the world resources that propel the various nations to
an uncertain future dwindle, more and more people are showing up here at these crossroads to trade, swap rumors, and share stories.  It has only been in the past 50 or so years that the races even began to mingle with one another. There is a sense of change in the air, and you are not the only who notices._

This is the first settlement outside your own lair that you will happen upon.

## The Caldera of Cromus ##

_This old volcanoâ€™s outer wall is a stark presence on the outer edge of the continent in the northwestern section. The Caldera actually creates three different climates due to its immense size and position to the predominant  sea winds that blow from the west to the east.  The sea based side is green and vegetation filled, whereas, the western side is a desert environment. The desert is famous for the black sand and has been thusly named the Black Desert. The top of Cromus is rarely seen due to the abundant cloud cover. It is known that there is heavy ice and snow at the unseen elevation. These extremes have kept explorers from really finding out what the interior of the Cromus holds.  There are rumors that say it is a place that time has forgotten._

## Aguana ##

_There is a river which begins on the south side of the Caldera named the Aguana.  It is fed from the rain as the clouds ascend over the caldera. The snow pack also contributes to the flow of water when the rare bit of sunshine penetrates to the snow. This river is a major fresh water source for the region, and is extensively used in the transportation of goods to the Seaport of Hyinth. It has been known to have devastating spring flooding but that also makes it a very fertile area for crops to be grown.  Small agricultural communities dot the banks making a network of stops for the traders.  The river community is very observant, and news is bartered, just like the goods._

## Hyinth ##

_Hyinth is an independent port and is run by the Federation.  The Federation is comprised of the Captains of the Sea vessels. The elected leader is known as the Prince of Tides.  It is a lifetime appointment, and bears with it the responsibility for the profit and defense of the harbor. Free trade, good entertainment, and stout defense of the harbor are a full time job for the Prince but there is also intrigue within the Federation. Lifetime appointments to rank have a small problem- they end with the cessation of life._

_The hustle and bustle of the port has an ebb and flow that mirrors the tide. Goods and services are moved through the Port and made available inland through the trade routes. This movement is not without peril. Bandits are frequent visitors along the trade routes and the response of the traders has been to hire guards.  The bandit attacks of late have become more devastating, and the response from the traders has been to hire the first Legionnaires. This represents the desperation of the traders and reinforces the legend that surrounds the Legion. This action has not gone unnoticed._

## Mount Zuldrom ##

_This massive based mountain is the center of the Earthen universe. It is rich in many resources and the interior has sustained the Earthen for millennia. Located in the southwestern portion of the continent it dominates the visual horizon for miles in all directions. A portion of the Anguan has been diverted to handle the removal of waste from the mining operations. The earthen have a protected water supply that comes from an aquifer built into the mount that channels rainwater into the Lake of Tears._

Within this mountain lay countless ruins, crypts and cave systems all
made by the Earthen long before the other Races even existed.  Lately there have been reports of the Undead and otherworldly creatures coming from the mine entrances into the mountain.  The locals who have seen these things have coined the term "Unnaturals" for the beings found in the heart of the Mountain.

The Unnaturals seem to be growing ever larger in strength and numbers int he recent months.

## Antean ##

_The central river of Avaloria it starts in the Spine Mountains and wends its way to the southern delta. It passes through the realm of the Erelania and contacts several of their cities located along the Spine. It is very fast flowing near the Spine from all of the run off. As it moves south it broadens out and slows down considerably. It is a major transportation thoroughfare to the city of Miasma._

## Voros ##

_The mighty Voros starts in the northeast and simply gets deeper and wider as it moves in a southwesterly direction. The course of the river has it pass the Stomping Grounds. There are many small communities that take advantage of the annual flooding for their crops. These communities tend to view the Voros with a religious respect since it regulates their entire lives with the annual cycles. There has not been a time when the Voros has not flooded according to the verbal histories in the river communities._

## The Badlands ##

_Located in the southeastern part of Avaloria it is an aptly named area filled with dark jagged rocks carved out by a glacier's retreat in the distant past. This has create an uninviting swath of land that seems to offer nothing. Harsh and unforgiving temperature extremes on a daily basis, deter any explorers, except the most determined. There is a feeling of being watched by those who have ventured into the area, and were able to make it back with the tale. The Bardoks have from all accounts adopted this area as their home, and their city of Cipher is located within the ravines - somewhere._

## Delta of Change ##

_At the finish of the three major rivers of the continent lies the Delta of Change. It is also home to Miasma, capital of The Unknowns. The delta is very rich in many forms of life, but the accumulated wastes of the technologies in use further upstream, have played havoc with the life forms structures. the delta also feeds into the Bogs of Despair that handle the flooding overflow. The sustained humidity of this region is legendary throughout Avaloria._
