# Deities in Avaloria #

There are quite a few deities and demi-god creatures within the land of Avaloria.  No entity really knows, or is responsible for the creation of the universe, and as such there is no unifying deity.  Many of the God's of the world are ancient souls who have been around since near the Dawn of Time.  Choosing to devote yourself to a deity has it's benefits, though depending on which you choose, it may have some consequences as well.

## An'Karith ##

As long as there has been a night sky, there has been An'Karith.  The moon glows red periodically on Avaloria from the pulsing magic of his rune-traced Hammer.  An'Karith can take on many forms, from a human to a simple house fly, he can be anywhere and nowhere all at once.  He is the oldest of the God's and attempts to keep the peace between the warring, younger, less experienced Deities.

## Slyth ##

Since the great receding of the glaciers created the glades there has been an energy and vitality that coalesced into Slyth. Quick and flexible as the tall grasses in the wind, Slyth has a mercurial quality to his view of what is right. He is absolute that the glades remain pure and undisturbed.  To this end he has shaped the Slythain to be the protectors of the glades and given them nature based spells. He has cultivated a very zealous worship from the Slythain and this has increased his power.  He has endowed his people with an enhanced form that comes out when blood has been shed on his altar - the glade.

As the glades increase in size and number the power of Slyth also increases. Will he be able to maintain his perspective, and the love of his people, as more non believers come to glades to plunder?

## The Green Warden ##

Oldest of the natural spirits, the Warden can be viewed as the conscious of the Forest. He is the physical manifestation of the trees and may appear in many forms depending on the needs of the forest. Most encounters have been with an elderly man who is dressed in a variety of green garments. This aspect takes a teacher role to aid in the understanding of the forest and it's needs.

A lesser known form, but one that inspires fear, is that of a green tree giant with glowing eyes, and is a terrible visage to behold. This aspect is the defender of the Forest and it's capacity for destruction is unmatched within the Forest confines. There are rumors of a third form but the exact understanding is very suspect.

The Green Warden and Sylth have a very strained relationship to say the very least. The edges of their domains are very contested and this affects all involved.

## Kaylynne ##

In the sound of the crashing waves and the smell of the seashore after low tide, you will find the essence of the demi-goddess Kaylynne. She is very young on the godly timescale, and currently only has one worshiper. Her existence in a corporeal way is bound to her worshiper.  This has set up an interesting dynamic not replicated anywhere else in Avaloria.

Kaylynne's power ebbs and flows in conjunction with the phases of the moon. Her domain is the area where the waves crash into the shore. This does not sound like much, but to her one worshiper, it is all that is needed. The future for this goddess is very tenuous. If she loses her worshiper, does she lose herself?

## Karg ##

It is hard to physically describe the entity known as Karg.  His form changes and reshapes itself constantly. This transformation process ebbs and flows with his moods, which are capricious, at best.  He is the Balancer, which is an odd thing to say, unless you reference it from the way The Unknowns must look at the world. He has always been there, and he is the strongest of them all. This allows for a balance from Order in their world, although it comes straight from Chaos. Given The Unknowns outcast status to most societies, little is known about Karg's abilities. That is getting ready to change, just like Avaloria.

|_Karg has amazing physical prowess and has never been defeated in hand to hand combat._|

|_Karg does not think of himself as a deity, but is showing the signs of ascension. He has the absolute trust, love and respect of The Unknowns._|
|_The voice of Karg is ever changing, but it is the law within the realm of The Unknowns._|
|_The touch of Karg can imbue phenomenal strength but it comes with a chance of insanity._|
