# Alchemy and Elixirs #

As far as any of the races can remember, there has been alchemy.  The art of combining the right herbs, with the right magical substances to create powerful elixirs.  An experienced alchemist can brew potions that cure the most horrific of wounds, allow you to breath underwater, or even in rare cases bring you back from the dead.  Alchemy has been around as long as the sky and the sea.  Since it is ingrained in the populace, you can find generic health and mana replenishment potions almost anywhere that sells things.

However, the more powerful potions will only be found as treasure since they are extremely rare and only made by the most powerful wizards in the land.
