Avaloria is a continent that has seen better times. The land is filled with the the remnants of advanced societies who have fallen from their former glory. Natural resources have become harder to find, and the industries that depend on their supply, are beginning to fail. Resource constraints have compounded the geographical divisions that make confrontations a new way of life. It is against this backdrop that players must try and succeed in their individual pursuit of fame and fortune or simply to survive.


## Earthen ##

_One of the oldest races, they are fair haired and tend to be physically imposing in both structure and timbre. They are workers who have lived their entire lives underground mining for the metals and gems needed for others. They are light skinned due to the constant toiling in the earth and they prefer to their underground cities to live in and remember the past when the metals flowed like water through their realm. The mining has begun to to contaminate the natural springs and start forcing the Earthen to go out away from their strong holds. They do this primarily at night because the sun is unpleasant. Patriarchal and deliberate would be the hallmarks of this society._

## Erelania ##

_Mountain tops are the home of these ruddy short people. They have a sense of balance that seemingly defies gravity. The colder air of the mountains has shaped this race in many ways while defining their culture and crafting. They are able to be very industrious when a task is set before them, but are also quick with a laugh and joke.  The society revolves around the family and is matriarchal in structure. An insult to a Erelanian's mother will draw a swift and violent response. The climate has begun to warm and the snows are not as deep. The passes to the lower lands have begun to open up for the first time in memory. Change is in the air, and how that will go, is the question troubling all._

"Relax, the answer is the colors."  "Only with balance can great heights be achieved."

## Gerdlings ##

_There have always been Gerdlings, but no one can agree when they became what they are today - preeminent traders of the land.  Their society is based on the art of the deal and the acquisition of wealth. Money talks throughout this society and they are nomadic as they pursue opportunities. They have a medium build and can show an amazing array of hairstyles and colors.  These hairstyles reflect the confidence and importance of the wearer. The greatest shame to a Gerdling, besides losing a trade, is being shorn of their hair. Bartering is the way of this realm and everything has its price. It is up to the Gerdlings to find it.  The loss of ready resources has made the deal more important than ever.  Challenges to the trade routes, due to climate, have become disturbing and there is now talk of hiring mercenaries.  "Change brings opportunity" is the mantra for this hardy resourceful group._

"Opportunity is a fickle mistress, but she can reward her apt students, beyond their imagination." 

## Bardoks ##

_Dark-skinned and dark-minded, this very secretive society has always been just outside the range of the general population. Rumors abound about what really goes on in their hideaways.  They could be assassins for hire, or necromancers, or anything that is never seen but only fleetingly felt. Always being in perpetual shadows and twilight, have given this race undeniable stealth and patience. What little is known about how they operate tends to suggest a system where achievements are rewarded and assignments are the mechanism for advancement.  True names are never revealed because of the power of that knowledge. Rather a professional name is bestowed to allow communication for assignments. There seems to be an equal opportunity with in the race as there is no discernible difference between male and female. The sun has begun to stay in the sky longer, while the night has receded to a very disturbingly short time.  This has begun to fray at the edges of this society, if the increase in sightings is to be believed._

" Patience is a necessity to grasp what the night has provided." 

## The Unknowns ##

_Dwellers who have been stunted and malformed by their close proximity to the wastes and toxins of the technological processes. Outcasts from every society seem to end up here and pay the price. There is a strongest rules mentality and it can be a very brutal environment.  Time and nature has created multi-generational society that is either speeding up evolution or increasing de-evolution. There has not been much inquiry into this area but the results are starting to show up. Survival of the fittest is just the beginning._

"Strength is honor." "Change is the norm, stasis the dream."
