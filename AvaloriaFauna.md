# Fauna #

There are many types of animals that have evolved to fill the variety of niches made available by the vast continent. Some have been around since the recording of things, while others are waiting to be discovered as the climate change continues.


# Mirror Water #

_In the new environment of the bog there is a sentient life form that has been given the name Mirror Water. This is an apt name for an entity that emulates the finest mirrors. The reflection is flawless and this draws their victim in for a closer look. This turns into a fatal mistake as the water erupts filling the nose mouth and lungs suffocating the prey. It then begins to dissolve the victim leaving no trace._

_The larger the body of Mirror Water, the larger the prey it seeks, and it adds a new trick to the attack.  Once the victim is looking at itself the mirror pulsates hypnotically causing the the loss of consciousness, and the victim falls into water to be devoured._

## Puffairy ##

_The innocuous look of these hand size leathery sacs belie their danger to a passer by. If they are recently fed, they will only discharge their spores by direct contact. If it has been a long time, then it will shoot the spores at the victim after sensing warmth. When either of these events occur the area becomes filled with a choking powder. The victim will need to get clear of the areas to stop the choking, but by then it is too late. The spores make their way to the lungs and stomach where the liquids activate a quick growth state that suffocates the victim within 24 hours._

_The Puffairy thrives in areas where the air is still so that the spores get maximum hang time. It only consumes the life form leaving the outside accoutrements alone, but will cover everything in hardened spores._

## Equstag ##

_As the glades became available the local herbivores rejoiced and began to enjoy the new found grasses. One of these was the Equstag. Slyth smiled upon it and changed it into what is found today. The stallions are over 28 hands high and sport an impressive rack of antlers. They are not for show, they are used with the intent to kill. The hooves are also meant to kill and maim. The mares are somewhat smaller but no less dangerous. They do not have antlers, but do have a very shrill whinny that calls all stallions to the area._

_Defense of the herd was the primary reason for the development of the antlers, but Slyth has incorporated defense of the glade as another.  With their size and the backing of a God these are formidable creatures._

|It is very difficult to surprise these creatures.|
|:------------------------------------------------|

|They have been known to fight to the death for their herd. They will fight to the death for the glade.|
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|They are highly sought after as mounts, but must be taken young, to have any chance to train.|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|There is a rumor that one people has found a way to compel service of an adult... but then again that is just a rumor.|
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Grass Whip ##

_The glades of Avaloria are home to this predator.  It is perfectly at home in the tall grasses and is very well camouflaged. It is very long and snake-like and moves much faster than most give it credit.  This is usually their last mistake, as this creature attacks and constricts its prey. Recently, the size of this predator has taken a dramatic increase that does not seem natural. It has become more aggressive and the attacks on much larger prey are more frequent.  Perhaps it has found favor with Sylth._

|Ambush predator|
|:--------------|

|Increase in size has reduced fear of prey size.  Will attack anything that moves through the glade.|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|Will not bother any creature that has found Sylth's favor.|
|:---------------------------------------------------------|

## Bearcat ##

_Nothing that moves within the forest can create a sense of pure fear as an adult bearcat. Cunning, tireless, and  completely without fear, they are the instrument of vengeance of the Green Warden. There are tales of a single bearcat taking out a town that was destroying the forest, without respecting the Green Warden's rules. While that is ancient lore, the recent incursions from the minions of Slyth into the Forest domain has spawned an entirely new bearcat response. If stories are to be believed, there are now packs of bearcats working as a unified team moving through the forest. The right hand of the Green Warden is evolving, and there is much to fear for those who earn his displeasure._

|Hunter and tracker that will go for miles to complete the task.|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|

|Absolutely no fear of anything ever encountered by the species.|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|

|Has the ability to keen, which all sentient beings must make a check against fear.|
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|Reports of encounters between Grasswhips and Bearcats have taken a dramatic increase. All observed have been to the death of one of the combatants.|
