# Capital Cities #

The continent has many wonders throughout the various areas but, the current societies are proudest of their capital cities.  These cities all harken back to the time when resources were not constrained and the future bright. Oh how times have changed.


## Rumination - Capital of the Eathen ##

_When the early days of the mining operations created a lot of waste, the Earthen were at a loss as to what to do with it. One enterprising engineer named Braith, noticed the waste had some interesting properties. Once he isolated the substance Coralite, the building of Rumination was begun.  Coralite is a reflective material that can be made into a concrete mixture that is light but very strong when it is dried.  It can, through the use of a an oven, be made into Coralite wool for insulation. The raw material mixed with a secret blend of chemicals can also be used as paper. This versatility defines Rumination from top to bottom._

_Rumination today has been standing in its current form for over 1,000 years.  there have been Coralite shortages for the last 10 years and the engineers are beginning to despair on finding a replacement.  The city is laid out in a very orderly fashion based on the needs of the mining operations. Oil Lamps are used extensively, and combined with the Coralite, make for a very well lit airy feel to the underground city.  Upon closer inspection, you can see the the the great amount of material that was taken away to provide the space for the city in the heart Mount Zuldrom._

_The city truly reflects the heart of Earthen society. It was laid out in a grid and all streets and houses and shops are set up according to need, and then functionality. There is a sense of pride in conformity that shows throughout the city even in the common areas. Form, fit, and functionality have been the guiding architectural guidelines since the beginning._

_Rumination is beginning to show signs of the lack of resources. Coralite that was in abundance has been in short supply for a decade. Areas needing repair show up as dark areas on buildings and streets.  This has caused a loss of lighting and the new shortage of oil has increased the areas of darkness that would have never been tolerated in the past.  Old timers mutter about inviting chaos with the darkness, but the younger Earthen seem not to hear them. The darkness has opened opportunity for some, and created an uneasiness never felt in the memory of the capital- or it's people._

## Airadein - Capital of the Erelania ##

_Given their mountain top isolation, the Erelania have made one of the most colorful capital cities with the construction of Aradein. The first impression that a visitor would get is that every color ever imagined has been used in the construction of this city.  Given the snow bound nature of their existence, the Erelania have chosen their city to represent the chaotic splendor of the rainbow. Colors are affixed to everything large and small. The effect is very dazzling to a newcomer, and it is only after a little time in the city do the colors begin to make sense._

_The city is a combination of preserved wood and an earthen mixture that adds the insulation needed against the environment.  Buildings look to be placed erratically about, but with some study, are actually a sophisticated weather control system. Wind and snow are shunted away from the main concourses leaving them clean and inviting. All of the homes are well lit and singularly built. The place that is the most unique is in the center of the city and cut into the mountaintop. Outsiders are not allowed to visit the Well of Solitude, it is used with great reverence by the Erelanians. It is rumored that if you have a question and you can make the trip to the Well, you will get an answer._



## The Conclave - mobile capital of the Gerdlings ##

_Since the Gerdlings are traders, they have no one place that they call home, but they do have an event that shapes them more than a stationary city - The Conclave.  This annual event occurs in the northeastern section of Avaloria.  The area is known as the Stomping Grounds, and during the The Conclave, it is filled with Gerdlings from across the continent. They arrive in all manner of transportation, and are literally herded into shape by the Conclave Crew._

_For all of the panoply and noise of The Conclave, it is a very serious event for the Gerdlings. Trading is conducted and hair styles are reviewed and judged.  While from the outside this event looks like rabble rousing, it is a great example of Gerdling ingenuity. Unless you are a Gerdling, you will never find the key meetings or events that will determine everything in the coming year._

_The transportation that brought the Gerdlings is much more than meets the eye. They are each capable of being a residence and turned into a defensive structure. This versatility is not generally known and falls into the rumor category.  The Crew are not just the organizers of The Conclave but, are also the paramilitary cadre of the Gerdlings. Trade secrets must remain just that - secrets._

_There is a rumor, and only the barest of one, that there is a secure permanent city known only as Sanctum. the whereabouts of this city is unknown. One can only imagine what the pre-eminent traders of the land may have in this location._

## Cipher - Codename for the the Capital of the Bardoks ##

_Rumored to be in the southeastern Badlands, Cipher is known for its absence of visibility. There is no known individual who is not a Bardokian who has been to Cipher. There are no maps or even references in any of the historical treatise from long ago.  There is one rare manuscript that has been played off as a drug induced fantasy called The Labyrinth. It is supposed to be a complete picture of Cipher done through allegory._

_If what is known through the details of The Labyrinth, and there is much debate over this, here are some of the possible facts. There are multiple entrances to the city but no one knows all of them. There is as many fake routes as there are real routes into the city proper. The structures are made to look natural to the environment but, they reflect no light, causing the entire area to be in shadow._

_Cipher is said to contain all of the resources needed for the Bardoks. The Labyrinth hints at the development of some very powerful tools and technologies deep inside of the city. The nature of this is not clear but is certainly heavily guarded. People who discuss Cipher openly have a tendency to disappear. An increase in the sightings of Bardoks, has many wondering what may be up in their city that takes them so far away from it?_

## Miasma - the capital and only city of The Unknowns ##

_Built on the delta created by the confluence of the three major rivers Anguan, Antean, and Voros, Miasma is a sprawling city of one story buildings on stilts. All of the toxins from the other societies are carried by the rivers, and end up in the delta where they are held by the mud. This is what contaminates the food chain and creates The Unknowns._

_The buildings are drab and made from local plants. They are very weather sturdy, which is a good thing, given their proximity to the cyclones that can come from the ocean. The simple structures allow the owners to have sanctuary from the world while dealing with the effects of their environment. The access to each structure is through the use of a ladder. The stronger and larger the occupant of the house the grander and larger the ladder structure._

_Privacy is respected in Miasma and there are strict protocols governing the conduct of the citizens. No one may enter another citizenâ€™s house without permission. Staring at another citizen is looked down upon and any insults are taken to the center of town to The Hill.  The Hill is 50 feet high and dominates a flattened circle around it. It is ringed with observation stands. A citizen who has been insulted will take the top of The Hill and announce who made the insult, and then defend the top of The Hill for 3 minutes against the named citizen.  If the insulted party remains on top of The Hill, then the offending citizen is publicly shamed and loses rank. The opposite happens if the insulted is toppled from The Hill._

_This system has been very effective in maintaining a semblance of order. Change is coming though, and there has been a request for additional hills, to handle the increase in citizen grievances. Strength has always ruled but recently something other than brawn has won. Change in the fastest changing people in Avaloria._
