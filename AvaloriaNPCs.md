# NPCs #

There are many different entities who exist all over the continent, and since the geographic divides are so severe, the diversity is very extreme.


## Shadow Jack ##

_The beginnings of the shadow jacks has been lost in the mists of a disjointed past.  One thing is for certain, they are mentioned in all of the cultures ever studied.  There are a few known facts, however, there are many more surrounded by supposition and conjecture. They are humanoid and are constrained to the shadows. They have a society but it’s structure is unknown. They are non-corporeal but can project into the material realm. Survivors of the encounters tell of an unbearable burning from the inside out, followed by a black rot appearing. How this occurs is still subject to debate. There does seem to be no discernible sex differentiation, even though, there has been noticeable size differences observed.  It is known that if there is shadow or twilight present, then the shadow jack can be there._

_The recent changes to the climate have begun to diminish the amount of night time. Rather than agitate the Shadow Jacks, this has caused an increased air of expectation. Some outside observers believe this climate change has been part of a prophecy for the Shadow Jacks, and something very big will happen when the time and conditions are right.  The little bit of insight that has been acquired tells of the black rose and a primal moon. One school of thought, holds that a messiah will deliver the Shadow Jacks into the daylight, fulfilling their ultimate destiny of "becoming"._

## Slythain ##

_The glades of Avaloria are a very new development in the geography and may hold precious resources untapped by any of the established societies.  This does not mean that the glades are uninhabited. On the contrary, there is a vibrant and dynamic society that is young and full of vitality.  They call themselves Slythain and they are zealous about the glades being pristine and allowed to reflect the beauty and freeness of their deity Slyth.  Slyth is a young diety, who is on the rise, in both power and stature. The closeness of the god and his chosen is very strong, and this has enabled the Slythain's rapid rise into a theocratic society. This has forged them into the sharp tip of the spear for Slyth._

_Slight of build and very hard to see in their native glades, they seem to flow without a trace through the grasses. The power of their god manifests in the ability to cast spells for all of the Slythain. These tend to be nature based, as the entire glade is really an altar to Slyth. As the inherent power of blood whets the altar’s appetite for more blood, it drives the Slythain into a berserker-like frenzy. This also changes the appearance of the Slythain into substantially hardened beings with thorns. All pretenses of stealth gone.  There are treasures and riches to be discovered in the glades but the peril is very real._

## Molto ##

_The Molto are always seen as a singular entity.  They look very heavy set and convey the weight of their existence as a weary sigh of resignation. They are actually a self actualized beings sent to find out what is causing all the changes. They have no clothing or instruments and actively try to communicate with those they encounter.  the sound  is a very low and sounds like rumbling but has a very distinct subsonic carrier.  Highly intelligent and curious, they will take a lot of abuse, before they turn their interest elsewhere in search of answers._

_They control fire and earth with a natural ease that astonishes those who meet them. If communication can be established, each Molto is actually a monk sent to learn of why their realm is becoming colder and if there is someone responsible.  Should their inner peace be disrupted their wrath is frightful to behold.  Ordinary weapons have no effect on them and as long as they on earth they can chose to be immovable. Knowledgeable wanderers, in search of an answer, defines these monastic emissaries._

## Kayleigh ##

_A plain and simple woman with long white hair, Kayleigh makes her home by the seashore and lives in a small cave. It is very difficult to tell how old she is by physical attributes.  She is a content personality with a calm serenity that compliments her simple appearance. Visitors to her cave will notice that is is appointed only with items of the sea._

_Kayleigh is most active at night and always takes time to commune with her goddess Kaylynne.  She does not do this in front of visitors. She may have a silver glow about her after speaking with her goddess and a smiling twinkle in her eye.  She will not actively volunteer any information concerning this phenomenon. Her belief is that by doing she is providing the example for others to follow._

_The sea has become much rougher in the recent weeks as the winds have picked up and the ground has trembled.  The shortening of the night has also had a distressing effect on Kayleigh.  She is concerned, but can not put her finger on the reason why. There have been people who have sought out her stability in the face of change. Rather than come and leave  as in the past, they are staying and waiting._

## Hedge Wizards ##

_Once an epithet of derision, uttered with contempt by those formally schooled in magic, Hedge Wizards have become beloved by those who actually meet them. They can be from any race and do tend to share several common traits.  They give practical advice in terms the people can understand. They care deeply about the environment. They are adept in many areas of magical discipline but demonstrate nothing on a grand scale. They may be male or female, but they all seem to develop one peculiar trait that links them throughout Avaloria - beards.  These are great flowing beards that seem to just get longer as the Hedge Wizard ages and works on behalf of the people. "Never trust a wizard with a razor!", is a common saying in Avaloria._

_The Hedge Wizards rarely are seen together, preferring the solitary lifestyle. Changes in the climate, and the rumors of happenings on the wind, have begun to change that._

## The Legion ##

_The Legion is a military like institution of very recent origins. Here is what is generally known about Legionnaires. They are scarlet clad from head to toe. They are always seen in pairs. Only their eyes are exposed and they are grim visages darkened with tattooing. They are well versed in all forms of combat and weaponry. They have never known defeat by any known organized force. They rarely speak to anyone not a fellow Legionnaire. Their word is their bond and all contracts will be completed - always._

_The Legion is independent and neutral. Their leader is unknown but is assumed to be a tactical genius without peer. Legionaries do use money, but only that which is of their own minting. The source of these coins is unknown, but they are all made of the same red gold material. This usage and requirement for payment to be rendered in the red gold has created a very strong currency much to the detriment of others in common use._

_Rumors about The Legion abound. They can not be killed. They never sleep. No one has seen more than 10 together, but they seem to be everywhere. Legion posts can spring up overnight. Should a contract ever be broken the consequences for the offending party will be swift and immediate. They are aliens to the continent, which is why no one has ever seen them without their scarlet attire._
