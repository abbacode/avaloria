# Skills #

---

There are an array of skills in Avaloria, some easy to obtain others not so much.  Some skills require a character to focus into a specific class.  Others are only known by the most powerful beings of the planet, and will not be let go so easily.

Once you have been trained in a particular skill, you are then able to spend experience you have earned to increase the overall effect of the particular skill.  You may do this at any time by using the skills command in game.


## Combat Skills ##

---


Varied and numerous are the combat skills of the world, most cause more damage than a normal every day strike.  Each time you use a combat skill it uses a certain amount of your balance.  Balance, is what measures your ability to fight without tiring.  The more you use your skills, the more your balance decreases.  At maximum unbalance, your main combat statistics (strength, dexterity, attack rating and armor rating) all are reduced by 50%.  This obviously allows enemies more of a chance to hit you, and critically hit you when they do score a hit.

Balance points come back over time, whether in or out of combat.
