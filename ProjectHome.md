## Avaloria Summary ##


Avaloria is a Multi user dungeon / Multi user strategy game being developed on the Evennia server.  The game will allow for player vs player combat, base building, leveling, spells, skills and all of the other lovely things that come with a MUD!  Currently the codebase is purely a hobby of mine that work on when I can.  Avaloria is aiming for an Alpha release soon.

The main difference between Avaloria and other MUD's once completed will be the ability for players to build up a large base (a dungeon, or a castle depending on alignment), in which the structures will give attribute bonuses, gold bonuses, exp bonuses...basically any bonus you can imagine will be able to be found not only on items and armor, but in how high you build up your lair.

Unbridled pk'ing will not be allowed, however you will be able to launch attacks on the opposite alignment's lair's in a structured way.
