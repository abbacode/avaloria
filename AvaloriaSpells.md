# Magic #

Magic in Avaloria comes from an unknown, undiscovered source.  As long as any inhabitant can remember, magic flowed like a river through the very fabric of the world.  If one is skilled enough, it can be drawn directly out of the air and used to destructive, or beneficial means.  Many think that only one being knows the true source of magic for the world...An'karith.  The eldest of the God's, he is an absolute master of the magical properties of the World.  But trying to come in contact with the ancient soul is near impossible.

There are groups who teach the ways of magic.  The Hedge Wizards are one such group, but they are elusive and hard to find.  Many of the "Gifted" learn on their own, or by the help of Faerie Guardians that find them, and show them the path.  The most powerful figures in Avalorian history were Magi, but lately their numbers have dwindled to near nil.


## Spells ##
